Notes:

Strings are immutable in javascript... we have to copy to change them

declare variables with var
the type will change based on the literal assigned to the var

Coercion:
If you add a number and a string, the number is coerced to a string.
If you add a boolean and a string, the boolean is coerced to a string.
If you add a number and a boolean, the boolean is coerced to a number.

readline gets strings not the original data type... how do we cast?
Number() and String()

the goal of this exercise is to:
print the sum of firstInteger and secondInteger
print the sum of firstDecimal and secondDecimal
print the concatenation of firstString and secondString
