Fruit.prototype.getInformation = function() {
    return 'This ' + this.type + ' is ' + this.color + '.';
}

prototypes allow methods and properties to be accesses by all instances of the fucntion

function declarations are "hoisted" as in can be referenced before they are declared


example of a class with a constructor
class Polygon {
    constructor(height, width) {
        this.height = height;
        this.width = width;
    }
    getArea() {
        return this.height * this.width;
    }
}
